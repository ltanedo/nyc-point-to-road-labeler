# nyc-point-to-road-labeler
A python libray to rapidly label single-points or complete geojson files against all ~150k roads in the 5 boroughs of NYC.  Implementation builds a lookup index from the NYC Open-Data Portal and efficiently matches using SKLearns KDTree.  Very useful in performing geospatial data science such as snapping certain incidents like traffic, crime, or event data to their retrospective roads. Also great for higher level detail analysis after clustering by NYC Census regions or Precincts.

## 1. Setup Guide
- Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Methods/Functions
> when running code, wait 60sec + for the roads.geojson to download from the NYC_Portal

- import the library 
```
import nyc_road_snapper as nyc
```

- get original points labeled with respective roads
```
origin = nyc.match_geojson(geojson_file = "Points Of Interest.geojson")
```
```
